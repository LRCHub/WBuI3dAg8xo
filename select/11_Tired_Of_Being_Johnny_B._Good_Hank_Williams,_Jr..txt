I don't like instant ice tea
And I aint crazy about dollar a gallon self service gasoline
And they nearly broke me with the high price of beef
And the funny thing is they think their putting this over on me

I've always been an upstanding citizen
But I am getting fed up now my friends
And if you don't understand what I've said
I'm tired of being Johnny B Good and I'm
Gonna be Johnny Reb

Yeah I'm gonna be Johnny Reb
'Cause I don't believe everything I've seen and read
And I work like hell just to keep a roof and a bed
I'm tired of being Johnny B Good and I'm
Gonna be Johnny Reb

This country's gettin' in a kinda bad shape
When the gasoline profits are up, up and away
And I can barely live on my take home pay
There's a whole lot of people that agree to what I say
Don't tell me to ride a bus and turn down my thermostat
When yer all runnin' around in jets and cadillacs

Well I can't take this lying down
We gotta try and fight back 'till they believe what we said
We're tired of being Johnny B Good and we
Gotta be Johnny Rebs

Yeah we gonna be Johnny Rebs
'Cause we don't believe everything we've seen and read
And we work like hell just to keep a roof and a bed
We're tired of being Johnny B Good and we
Gotta be Johnny Rebs

We're Tired of being Johnny B Good and we
Gotta be Johnny Rebs
